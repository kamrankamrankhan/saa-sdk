Public exports:

    AttentionEngine          - listens to the hidden hosted agent's data
                               channel events and fires typed callbacks.
    start_attention_session  - summons the hosted agent into your room.
    attention_agent_token    - issues the hidden-participant token the
                               hosted agent uses to connect.
    build_attention_entrypoint - factory that composes the above into a
                                 ready-to-go entrypoint(ctx) function.

Event types:
    PredictionEvent, VADEvent, TurnReadyEvent, TurnFrame,
