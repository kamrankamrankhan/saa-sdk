"""Bridge + CallSession interfaces for SAA-gated Twilio voice agents.

The adapter (``server.py``) handles Twilio Media Streams and SAA gating;
a :class:`Bridge` is the seam between it and your STT / LLM / TTS stack.

Lifecycle, per call:

    session = TwilioCallSession(...)        # adapter creates one per call
    await bridge.open(ctx, session)         # adapter hands the session in

    # 0+ on_speech calls as the caller talks (gated by SAA)
    # 0+ on_dtmf calls if the caller presses keys
    # 0+ on_user_speech_started calls (barge-in signal, caller talking again)
    # 0+ on_mark_played calls when Twilio confirms a <mark> reached the caller

    await bridge.close()                    # exactly once, even on disconnect

Outbound TTS audio reaches the caller via two interchangeable channels:

* push raw bytes to ``bridge.outbound_pcm16_16k`` (back-pressure friendly
  ``asyncio.Queue``, the adapter paces and chunks for you), or
* call ``session.send_audio(pcm16_16k)`` directly when you need finer
  control (mid-stream ``clear`` for barge-in, named ``mark`` for playback
  synchronisation, programmatic hangup).

This module ships :class:`LoggingBridge` as a reference; the README
points to ``bridge_openai_realtime.py`` for a full STT/LLM/TTS bridge.

    Methods are awaited on the FastAPI event loop and are safe to call
    from any task that has the session reference. All methods are no-ops
    once the call has ended.

    SAA controls (``mark_responding`` / ``mute`` / ``unmute`` /
    ``set_threshold``) are the high-leverage telephony hooks documented in
    the SDK README:

      * ``mark_responding(True)`` while the agent's TTS is playing tells the
        SAA server to suppress predictions during playback, so SAA does NOT
        fire ``turn_ready`` on its own TTS bleed coming back through the
        carrier echo path. Pair with ``mark_responding(False)`` when the
        agent finishes speaking.
      * ``mute`` / ``unmute`` are the privacy controls, PCM is dropped at
        the client and never reaches the SAA server while muted.
      * ``set_threshold`` retunes the device-class confidence threshold
        mid-call (raise in noisy environments; lower for quiet callers).

    The default :class:`LoggingBridge` and the reference
    ``bridge_openai_realtime.OpenAIRealtimeBridge`` both wire
    ``mark_responding`` automatically around their TTS playback windows.
