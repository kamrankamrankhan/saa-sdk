# Examples

Runnable integrations of SAA into voice-agent stacks. Each consumes a public package — no example depends on a private model artifact.

## LiveKit Agents

The shipped integration. SAA joins your LiveKit room as a hidden participant (the hosted bridge) and gates the session through the `"saa"` data topic. Three samples in [`livekit/`](./livekit):

| Sample | What it shows | Run |
|---|---|---|
| [`livekit/voice_agent_cascaded/`](./livekit/voice_agent_cascaded) | SAA gating a cascaded pipeline (Silero VAD → Deepgram STT → OpenAI LLM → Cartesia TTS), with barge-in and proactive interjection. | `python src/agent.py dev` |
| [`livekit/voice_agent_realtime/`](./livekit/voice_agent_realtime) | SAA gating an OpenAI Realtime speech-to-speech agent — the case stock LiveKit can't gate (no VAD slot). | `python agent.py dev` |
| [`livekit/web/`](./livekit/web) | A vanilla HTML + `livekit-client` browser client rendering SAA's prediction overlay, plus a dev FastAPI token server. | `uvicorn token_server:app` |

All target **LiveKit Agents 1.5.x** (`AgentServer` + `@server.rtc_session()`). See [`livekit/README.md`](./livekit/README.md) for the shared environment and the five lines that integrate SAA.

## Roadmap

Packaged drop-in adapters for the stacks below are planned. They depend on an external-frame ingestion API landing in `attenlabs-saa` (so SAA can consume audio a framework already captured); until then these stacks are reachable by wiring the streaming SDK yourself.

| Stack | Shape |
|---|---|
| Twilio Media Streams | μ-law 8 kHz → PCM16 telephony bridge |
| Pipecat | `FrameProcessor`-style gate before STT |
| OpenAI Realtime | browser/edge gating of a realtime model |
| ElevenLabs Conversational AI | WebRTC gating |
| Proactive-agent overlays | per-stack `mark_responding` lifecycle recipes |

## Conventions

- `ATTENLABS_TOKEN` is the streaming-SDK auth token; `SAA_API_KEY` is the LiveKit hosted-bridge key. Get one at [attentionlabs.ai](https://attentionlabs.ai).
- LiveKit samples additionally need `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`, plus per-sample provider keys. See each sample's `.env.example`.
