# Examples

Runnable integrations of SAA into voice-agent stacks. Each consumes a public package — no example depends on a private model artifact.

## LiveKit Agents

SAA joins your LiveKit room as a hidden participant (the hosted bridge) and gates the session through the `"saa"` data topic. Three samples in [`livekit/`](./livekit):

| Sample | What it shows | Run |
|---|---|---|
| [`livekit/voice_agent_cascaded/`](./livekit/voice_agent_cascaded) | SAA gating a cascaded pipeline (Silero VAD → Deepgram STT → OpenAI LLM → Cartesia TTS), with barge-in and proactive interjection. | `python src/agent.py dev` |
| [`livekit/voice_agent_realtime/`](./livekit/voice_agent_realtime) | SAA gating an OpenAI Realtime speech-to-speech agent — the case stock LiveKit can't gate (no VAD slot). | `python agent.py dev` |
| [`livekit/web/`](./livekit/web) | A vanilla HTML + `livekit-client` browser client rendering SAA's prediction overlay, plus a dev FastAPI token server. | `uvicorn token_server:app` |

All target **LiveKit Agents 1.5.x** (`AgentServer` + `@server.rtc_session()`). See [`livekit/README.md`](./livekit/README.md) for the shared environment and the five lines that integrate SAA.

## Pipecat (on Daily)

The Pipecat sibling. SAA joins your Daily room as a hidden participant and publishes events on Daily's app-message channel under the `"saa"` topic. Your Pipecat pipeline consumes them through `AttentionEngine`, which hooks `DailyTransport.event_handler("on_app_message")`. Two samples in [`pipecat/`](./pipecat):

| Sample | What it shows | Run |
|---|---|---|
| [`pipecat/voice_agent_cascaded/`](./pipecat/voice_agent_cascaded) | SAA gating a cascaded Pipecat pipeline (Silero VAD → Deepgram STT → OpenAI LLM → Cartesia TTS) on Daily, with barge-in and proactive interjection. | `python src/agent.py` |
| [`pipecat/web/`](./pipecat/web) | A vanilla HTML + `@daily-co/daily-js` browser client rendering SAA's prediction overlay, plus a dev FastAPI token server that creates an ephemeral Daily room. | `uvicorn token_server:app` |

Targets **pipecat-ai >= 1.0.0** (the `pipecat.transports.daily.transport` canonical import path) and **daily-python >= 0.19.0**. See [`pipecat/README.md`](./pipecat/README.md) for the shared environment.

## ElevenLabs Conversational AI

ElevenLabs runs its agent inside its own sealed WebRTC room, so this sample uses the **streaming SDK's `feed_audio` ingestion**: it taps ElevenLabs' Python `AudioInterface` (the clean PCM seam), feeds the user mic to the SAA cloud, and gates the agent on the events that come back. 

| Sample | What it shows | Run |
|---|---|---|
| [`elevenlabs/voice_agent/`](./elevenlabs/voice_agent) | SAA gating an ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent — only device-directed speech reaches the model — via `attenlabs-saa`'s `feed_audio`. | `python agent.py` |

Needs **attenlabs-saa >= 0.4.0** (the `feed_audio` API) and **elevenlabs >= 2.45**.

## Roadmap

`attenlabs-saa` ships `feed_audio` (external-frame ingestion), so any stack that already captures audio can be gated by feeding SAA

| Stack | Shape |
|---|---|
| Twilio Media Streams | μ-law 8 kHz → PCM16 telephony bridge (`feed_audio(..., sample_rate=8000)`) |
| OpenAI Realtime | browser/edge gating of a realtime model |
| Proactive-agent overlays | per-stack `mark_responding` lifecycle recipes |

## Conventions

- `SAA_API_KEY` is your Attention Labs API key — the same credential for both the streaming SDK and the hosted bridge (LiveKit and Pipecat). Get one at [attentionlabs.ai](https://attentionlabs.ai).
- LiveKit samples additionally need `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`, plus per-sample provider keys. See each sample's `.env.example`.
- Pipecat samples need `DAILY_API_KEY` (Daily REST, customer-owned — mints the hidden-bot meeting token locally; never seen by our broker), plus a `DAILY_ROOM_URL` + bot meeting token for the cascaded sample, plus per-sample provider keys.
