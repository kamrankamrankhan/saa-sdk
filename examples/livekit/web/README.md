# web — browser front-end for a SAA-gated LiveKit voice agent

A vanilla HTML/JS client that joins a LiveKit room, publishes cam+mic, plays the
agent's voice, and renders SAA's gating decisions as a live overlay.

The pill flips green only when you're addressing the device,
which is exactly when the agent is allowed to hear you.

> **Requires a voice agent.** This is a front-end, not a standalone app. It needs
> one of the voice-agent workers running in the **same LiveKit project** — that
> worker owns the SAA session and answers you:
> [`voice_agent_cascaded`](../voice_agent_cascaded) or
> [`voice_agent_realtime`](../voice_agent_realtime). Without an agent in the room
> there is no SAA session and nothing to talk to.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`token_server.py`](./token_server.py) | tiny FastAPI endpoint — mints a browser LiveKit join token and serves the static files. No SAA here. |
| [`index.html`](./index.html) | UI shell (prediction pill, confidence bar, VAD/faces, video). |
| [`app.js`](./app.js) | connects to the room, publishes tracks, plays the agent's audio, renders the `"saa"` overlay. |
| [`turn-parser.js`](./turn-parser.js) | decodes the binary turn payload (PCM16 + JPEGs). |
| [`styles.css`](./styles.css) | minimal styling. |

## Run

Both halves read the shared [`examples/livekit/.env`](../.env.example), so
`LIVEKIT_*` is identical by construction — fill it in once:
`cd examples/livekit && cp .env.example .env`.

**Terminal 1 — a voice agent** (owns SAA, auto-dispatches into new rooms):

```bash
cd ../voice_agent_realtime          # or ../voice_agent_cascaded
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e ../../../packages/saa-livekit-client
set -a && source ../.env && set +a
python agent.py dev
```

**Terminal 2 — this token server:**

```bash
cd examples/livekit/web
pip install -r requirements.txt
set -a && source ../.env && set +a
uvicorn token_server:app --port 8000
# open http://localhost:8000 and click Start
```

Start the agent **first** so it's registered to receive the room dispatch. When
you click Start, the browser creates a room, the agent auto-joins, summons SAA,
and starts talking — you'll hear it and watch the pill go green when you address
it. Status shows `waiting for agent…` until the agent's audio arrives.

## How the overlay is wired

SAA events arrive as JSON on the `"saa"` data topic — published by the hidden SAA
agent that the *voice agent* summoned. The integration surface is two functions
in `app.js`:

- `renderPrediction(msg)` — reads `msg.aligned_class` (0/1/2), `msg.confidence`, `msg.num_faces`
- `renderVAD(msg)` — reads `msg.is_speech`

`turn_ready` / `interjection` arrive as a JSON envelope plus a binary byte stream
on the same topic; `onByteStream` reassembles it and `parseTurnPayload` decodes
the PCM + frames.

## Production warning

`token_server.py` is **dev-only**: open CORS, mints a token for any
`room`/`identity`. For production you need auth on `/token`, rate limiting, and a
real room/identity policy. LiveKit API secrets must stay server-side — the
browser only ever receives the join token.
